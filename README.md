# Git-Playground

In this repo: I played around with Git Advanced concepts that I'm likely to use or encounter while either working on my own projects or collaborating with others. I have had a look at:
- Rebase to edit history
- Cherry Pick to move around commits
- Revert to undo changes
- Reset to unwind changes
- Undo anything in Git
- Contributing to open source projects

This is a foundation for my collaboration with others, and incoorporating parallel workflows into my work.
